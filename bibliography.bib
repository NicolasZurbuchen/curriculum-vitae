	ABSTRACT = {Falls are dangerous for the elderly, often causing serious injuries especially when the fallen person stays on the ground for a long time without assistance. This paper extends our previous work on the development of a Fall Detection System (FDS) using an inertial measurement unit worn at the waist. Data come from SisFall, a publicly available dataset containing records of Activities of Daily Living and falls. We first applied a preprocessing and a feature extraction stage before using five Machine Learning algorithms, allowing us to compare them. Ensemble learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting have the best performance, with a Sensitivity and Specificity both close to 99. Our contribution is: a multi-class classification approach for fall detection combined with a study of the effect of the sensorsâ€™ sampling rate on the performance of the FDS. Our multi-class classification approach splits the fall into three phases: pre-fall, impact, post-fall. The extension to a multi-class problem is not trivial and we present a well-performing solution. We experimented sampling rates between 1 and 200 Hz. The results show that, while high sampling rates tend to improve performance, a sampling rate of 50 Hz is generally sufficient for an accurate detection.},

	abstract={The proportion of people 60 years old and above is expected to double globally to reach 22  by 2050. This creates societal challenges such as the increase of age-related illnesses and the need for caregivers. Falls are a major threat for the elderly, often causing serious injuries especially when the fallen person stays on the ground for a long time without assistance. This paper presents the development of a Fall Detection System (FDS) using an accelerometer combined with a gyroscope worn at the waist. Data come from SisFall, a publicly available dataset containing records of Activities of Daily Living and falls. We compared five Machine Learning algorithms.
